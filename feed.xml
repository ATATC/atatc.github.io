I strongly recommend you keep a unit test that calculates everything you have for Deliverable 1, because as you modify your project, it is very likely some parts will go off. Keeping the unit test can verify that new changes do not have a negative impact on the other functionalities. In our repository, you can find the unit test <a href="https://github.com/ATATC/CIV102-Bridge-Project/blob/main/deliverable1.py">here</a>. Another thing I knew before putting my hands on the framework was that it needs to be modular. Although if you use our solution, you probably do not care about the philosophy behind programming, but if you decide to write your own codes, I recommend you keep a similar structure as ours. The biggest difficulty I had was implementing automatic composition of complex cross-sections. Since in the handout they want us to be analytical, I had never thought about writing the framework in differentiable tensors, though if you use PyTorch, the optimization process will be much faster.</p> <p>The link to our repository can be found on the top of this page.</p> <p>Once you have the framework, you can start optimizing the dimensions of the cross-section. In <a href="https://github.com/ATATC/CIV102-Bridge-Project/blob/main/optimize_cross_section.py">this file</a> we acquired the optimal cross-section to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{"top": 100.2, "bottom": 60.7, "height": 160, "thickness": 1.27, "outreach": 28}</code>. You can find a reference of what these dimensions are in <a href="https://github.com/ATATC/CIV102-Bridge-Project/blob/e5138397f29d2300124a18a151adba09dadadc41/bridger/cross_section.py#L414-L464">“cross_section.py”</a> . This was basically our Design 1. By manually changing the distance between diaphragms, we knew that once the spacing goes below 140 mm, it no longer changes the maximum load. So we decided to have 9 intervals and 10 diaphragms.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-cross-section-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-cross-section-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-cross-section-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-cross-section.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-displaced-shape-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-displaced-shape-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-displaced-shape-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-displaced-shape.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We know that having a small anti-smile curve is going to help resist the positive bending moments. So we decided to model the impact of increasing the height of the center 1/3 of the beam by another layer of matboard (1.27 mm). In <a href="https://github.com/ATATC/CIV102-Bridge-Project/blob/main/design1.py">“design1.py”</a> we calculated that a uniform beam resists 1193 N and with the slight curve it goes up to 1204 N. Therefore, we built our prototype with the curve.</p> <h3 id="design-2-varying-cross-section">Design 2: Varying Cross-section</h3> <p>By looking at the formulas $\tau=\frac{VQ}{Ib}$ and $\sigma=\frac{My}{I}$, we know that at the ends, where the shear force is the largest, we want smaller Q values to bring down the stress caused by the shear force, whereas close to the center, where the bending moment dominates, we want larger I values so that the moment-related stresses are dissipated. Thus, we know that the height of the cross-section should be increasing on each half of the bridge. We calculated both trapezoid and parabolic shapes in <a href="https://github.com/ATATC/CIV102-Bridge-Project/blob/main/design2.py">“design2.py”</a>. The trapezoid was much easier to build, so we went with that for the second prototype.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design2-displaced-shape-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design2-displaced-shape-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design2-displaced-shape-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design2-displaced-shape.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Also, if we compare the displaced shapes of Design 1 and Design 2, we can see that the trapezoid does reduce the deformation.</p> <h2 id="prototypes">Prototypes</h2> <p>We knew we were gonna f**k up the first try, so we bought 3 matboards with the identical dimensions and color from <a href="https://www.michaels.com">Michaels</a> Custom Framing Department. Another reason for prototyping was that we had two designs (Design 1 and Design 2) and we wanted to compare them. We used hot glue gun instead of the glue cement so that it did not take three days before we could test them.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/on-the-way-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/on-the-way-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/on-the-way-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/on-the-way.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h3 id="design-1">Design 1</h3> <p>If you are building your bridge in the same orientation, meaning that the open end of the U shape is in contact with the top flange, we suggest you glue it in the same sequence as we did.</p> <p>Our bridge consisted of two segments, connected by a splice at the 2/3 position. The top flange was split at the 1/3 position. We put our rectangles in <a href="https://www.opticutter.com">optiCutter</a> to plan our cutting. Our plan PDF is available <a href="https://github.com/ATATC/CIV102-Bridge-Project/blob/main/CIV102Bridge.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p>In our first prototype, our cutting skill was terrible. We later learned that we should have scored the lines with a ruler before cutting. We improved in the final manufacturing. However, the bad cutting quality resulted in the fact that none of the diaphragms in the first prototype had the same height or touched the top flange. We had to add small pieces to fill the gaps.</p> <p>We had even spacing for the diaphragms, however, since the shear forces at the two ends are significantly higher, we need better support. What we did initially was folding one diaphragm into an isosceles triangle without the hypotenuse on each end. The joint diaphragm at the splice was also folded in the same way so it connects the two segments.</p> <p>We glued all the diaphragms in the small segment to the bottom and one side, and then glued the other side before we sealed the top. The second step was to glue the joint diaphragm onto the large segment and then follow the same procedure as the first step to close the large segment. The third step was to wrap the splice with a thin matboard. After that, the final step was to glue the top flange on the bottom U shape.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-11-25-bridge/design1-prototype3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We tested the beam by me sitting on it.

A larger 45-degree right triangle with the hypotenuse touching both sides was determined to be the best, although it still failed due to nonaxial torque when our heaviest member stepped on it.
