MIP Candy is Project Neura's next-generation infrastructure framework for medical image processing. It defines a handful
of common network architectures with their corresponding training, inference, and evaluation pipelines that are
out-of-the-box ready to use. Additionally, it also provides integrations with popular frontend dashboards such as
Notion, WandB, and TensorBoard.

We provide a flexible and extensible framework for medical image processing researchers to quickly prototype their
ideas. MIP Candy takes care of all the rest, so you can focus on only the key experiment designs.
