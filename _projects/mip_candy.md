MIP Candy is Project Neura's next-generation infrastructure framework for medical image processing. It integrates a
handful number of common network architectures with their corresponding training, inference, and evaluation pipelines
that are out-of-the-box ready to use. Additionally, it also provides adapters to popular frontend dashboards such as
Notion, WandB, and TensorBoard.
