With the rapid development of electric vehicles, formula races that face high school and university students have become
more popular than ever as the threshold for design and manufacturing has been lowered. In many cases, we see teams
inspired by or directly using toolkits and technologies inherited from standardized commercial vehicles. These
architectures are usually overly complicated for amateur applications like the races. In order to improve the efficiency
and simplify the development of instrumentation, control, and analysis systems, we propose LEADS (Lightweight Embedded
Assisted Driving System), a dedicated solution for such scenarios {% cite fu2024leads %}.
