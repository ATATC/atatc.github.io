# macOS or Windows, which is better for developers?

## Background

The first computer I bought in 2015 for programming was a Lenovo Rescuer 15-ISK equipped with an Intel Core i7-6700HQ
processor and a GeForce GTX 960M GPU. I can recall little memory about this laptop, so I'll just skip it.

In 2018, when the first generation of Intel Core i9 processors were released, I bought a DELL G7 7588 that had an Intel
Core i9-8950HK processor with a GeForce GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU. Back in the time, that was one of the most powerful laptops
on the shelf.

My journey with PyCharm started the same year. I also got addicted to GTA V because the graphics were so smooth on that
laptop. The coding experience was fine since the only operating system I had used was Windows 10, although I remember
the most significant downside of that laptop was the overheating problem with the chip. Every time I played GTA V or ran
caching for PyCharm, the top left area of the keyboard would become so hot that I literally would get hurt touching it.
Perhaps I should have started shorting Intel stocks back then lol.

Later in 2018, or probably the beginning of 2019, Nvidia released the GeForce RTX series. That was the first time I
heard of ray tracing. I bought an ROG Strix RTX 2070 right after release, before having any other components of a PC. I
used an ASUS PCI-E extension box to connect the GPU to the laptop, but the improvement compared to the integrated GTX
1060 Max-Q was negligible. Thus, I had no choice but to buy a whole PC. I chose Intel Core i9-9900k to be the processor
and an ROG Maximus XI Extreme to be the motherboard, which formed my first workstation. The motherboard turned out to be
quite unstable. I remember many times it just went blue screen for no reason, which really pissed me off. I still do not
know why, but my suspicion is in the memory sticks. One thing I soon liked about the workstation was that I could leave
it running 24/7 without worrying about it going to sleep. In contrast, there were many times when I found my laptop had
just randomly rebooted sometime between when I folded it and when I opened it.

In 2019, I bought the last Apple MacBook Pro that had an Intel chip in it - the 2019 MacBook Pro 16 with an 8-core 2.4
GHz Intel Core i9 and an AMD Radeon Pro 5600M GPU with 8 GB of HBM2 memory. Everywhere, from the touch bar to the OS
icons, showed me Apple's superior aesthetics over Microsoft, yet the hot-surface issue remained (thanks to Intel).

In early 2021, I upgraded my workstation by replacing the motherboard and processor with a new AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and the
corresponding ROG motherboard.

After I moved to Canada, in early 2023, right after release, I bought an ROG Strix RTX 4090, which happened to be my
best investment ever (by the time I write this, the market price is still much higher than the price I bought it for). I
sold my RTX 2070 and put in the new RTX 4090. The improvement was so impressive. Not only my gaming experience was much
better, but I also fixed 99% of the PyTorch OOM issues with the new 24 GB VRAM.

In 2024, I upgraded my MacBook to a new Apple MacBook Pro 14 with an Apple M3 chip (16 GB).
