# macOS or Windows, which is better for developers?

## Background

The first computer I bought in 2015 for programming was a Lenovo Rescuer 15-ISK equipped with an Intel Core i7-6700HQ
processor and a GeForce GTX 960M GPU. I can recall little memory about this laptop, so I'll just skip it.

Later in 2018, when the first generation of Intel Core i9 processors were released, I bought a DELL G7 7588 that had an
Intel Core i9-8950HK processor with a GeForce GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU. Back in the time, that was one of the most powerful
laptops on the shelf.

My journey with PyCharm started the same year. I also got addicted to GTA V because the graphics were so smooth on that
laptop. The coding experience was fine since the only operating system I had used was Windows 10, although I remember
the most significant downside of that laptop was the overheating problem with the chip. Every time I played GTA V or ran
caching for PyCharm, the top left area of the keyboard would become so hot that I literally would get hurt touching it.
Perhaps I should have started shorting Intel stocks back then lol.
