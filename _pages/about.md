I'm currently an undergraduate student in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca) 2T9 at the University of
Toronto St. George. My major interest is in the field of Computer Vision, which includes Autonomous Racing and Medical
Image Processing. I am also a full-stack developer who mainly focuses on Next.js, SpringBoot, and MySQL.

I started working as a full-stack developer since middle school in Shanghai. My research career started in high school
at [Villanova College](https://www.villanovacollege.org). Later I did an internship in MIP at
[Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai).

Earlier in 2019, I founded [Project Neura](https://projectneura.org) and held tens of projects with other members.
Noticeably, we developed LEADS as a collaborative project with the
[VeC](https://www.villanovacollege.org/student-life/vec-project) team, which is a club in my high school that aims to
compete in the [University of Waterloo EV Challenge](https://uwaterloo.ca/electric-vehicle-challenge). I'm still active
in the VeC Steering Council even though I have left high school.

In summer 2025, I started leading a small research group that aims at conference workshop challenges. We are actively
recruiting undergraduate or high-school students who have built a certain fundamental understanding in deep learning,
especially bioinformatics, and are ready to invest a decent amount of time and effort. Feel free to reach out to
[me](mailto:terry.fu@projectneura.org) if you are interested.

In my first semester at the University of Toronto, I joined [UTMIST](https://www.utmist.ca) as an internal research
team lead working on the AIP project.
